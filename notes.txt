INSERT
The insert function does not scale well. It seems to have resonable times with smaller arrays.
This has to do with the fact that this runtime is linear, or O(n). 
But once you get into array sizes of 1,000 + elements it really slows down. 


APPEND
The append function appears to scare much better. As it doesn't build on itself, so the runtime is constant,
or O(1).

The insert function appears to take hunderes of times longer then the append.
This is because insert has to move and modify each new element.
Whereas the append function only has to modify and edit the last slot.
